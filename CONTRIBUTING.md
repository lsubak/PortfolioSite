Hello!

Thank you for your interest, but this is a personal portfolio website meant to showcase my own skills and try out my own stuff. I'm not looking for other contributors at the moment.

You might check out some of the links under http://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#finding-a-project-to-contribute-to, where you can find lots of open source projects looking 
for contributors. They'd love your help! :)
