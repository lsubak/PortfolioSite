# PortfolioSite
### Welcome! 
This is the Github project for my personal portfolio site at [lsubakportfolio.com](https://lsubakportfolio.com)
It's a place for me to get back in the groove of software development after my focus on college for graphic design, a place for me to showcase my graphic design work, and a place for me to just try things out.
<br /><br />Have a look! :) And check out the issues tab for future fixes/features planned.

If you're just looking around, feel free to use any of the existing code as an example or in your own projects if you like it.
However, please do NOT use any of the images in this repository for your own use without my express permission (and in turn, without the express permission of any copyrighted type within the images). Thanks!
